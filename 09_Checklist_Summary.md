# Checklist Summary

## Quick Reference Security Checklist for REST APIs

This summary provides a consolidated checklist covering all critical security aspects for REST API development and deployment. Use this for quick audits and security reviews.

---

##  Authentication
- [ ] Use standard authentication protocols (OAuth 2.0/OIDC, JWT) - never invent your own
- [ ] Enforce strong password policies following NIST guidelines
- [ ] Secure JWT implementation:
  - [ ] Use strong secret keys (‚â•256 bits)
  - [ ] Use correct algorithms (RS256 preferred over HS256)
  - [ ] Set short expiration times (15 minutes max)
  - [ ] Implement refresh token flow
  - [ ] Include proper claims (aud, iss)
- [ ] Implement brute-force protection with account lockout
- [ ] Use rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- [ ] Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users

## Ô∏è Authorization
- [ ] Never trust client data for authorization decisions
- [ ] Enforce Principle of Least Privilege
- [ ] Implement robust access control on every request
- [ ] Verify resource ownership for all resource access
- [ ] Use centralized authorization mechanism
- [ ] Implement RBAC or ABAC
- [ ] Filter collection results based on user permissions

## ‚úÖ Data Validation
- [ ] Use schema-based validation for all inputs
- [ ] Validate type, format, length, and range
- [ ] Practice allow-listing, not deny-listing
- [ ] Sanitize and encode output to prevent XSS
- [ ] Prevent Mass Assignment vulnerabilities
- [ ] Use parameterized queries for database access

##  Rate Limiting & Throttling
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- [ ] Use appropriate limiting strategy (IP + User-based)
- [ ] Set different tiers for sensitive vs. regular endpoints
- [ ] Return proper 429 responses with Retry-After headers
- [ ] Implement throttling for resource-intensive operations
- [ ] Set limits on request payload size

##  Secure Headers
- [ ] Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS): `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- [ ] Content-Security-Policy (CSP): `default-src 'self'`
- [ ] X-Content-Type-Options: `nosniff`
- [ ] X-Frame-Options: `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`
- [ ] Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: `same-origin`
- [ ] Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: `same-origin`
- [ ] Configure CORS properly (no wildcards in production)

## üìä Logging & Monitoring
- [ ] Log all important events (requests, auth, errors, data changes)
- [ ] Never log sensitive information (passwords, keys, PII)
- [ ] Use standardized log format (JSON)
- [ ] Centralize logs in dedicated system
- [ ] Implement monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up automated alerts for suspicious events

##  Secrets Management
- [ ] Never hardcode secrets in source code
- [ ] Don't store secrets in configuration files
- [ ] Use dedicated secrets management solution
- [ ] Inject secrets at runtime from secure storage
- [ ] Implement automated key rotation
- [ ] Apply least privilege to secret access

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling
- [ ] Implement global error handler
- [ ] Return generic error messages to clients
- [ ] Log detailed errors server-side only
- [ ] Use appropriate HTTP status codes

## üö® Critical Security Risks to Address

Based on OWASP API Security Top 10:
1. **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**
2. **Broken Authentication**
3. **Excessive Data Exposure**
4. **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting**
5. **Injection Flaws**

## üìã Pre-Deployment Security Review

Before deploying your API to production:

- [ ] Complete all checklist items above
- [ ] Conduct security testing (penetration testing)
- [ ] Review and update security documentation
- [ ] Verify all secrets are properly managed
- [ ] Test error handling and logging
- [ ] Validate rate limiting effectiveness
- [ ] Confirm monitoring and alerting are active
- [ ] Review access controls and permissions

---

## üîÑ Ongoing Security Maintenance

- [ ] Regularly rotate secrets and keys
- [ ] Monitor security logs and alerts
- [ ] Update dependencies for security patches
- [ ] Review and update access permissions
- [ ] Conduct periodic security assessments
- [ ] Stay updated on new security threats
- [ ] Review and update security policies
