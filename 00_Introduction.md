# 0. Introduction: Why API Security Matters

APIs are the connective tissue of the modern digital world. They power everything from the app you use to order coffee to complex financial systems trading billions of dollars. Because they handle so much sensitive data and business logic, they are a primary target for malicious actors.

## üö® The OWASP API Security Top 10

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a dedicated list of the Top 10 API Security Risks. This list highlights the most critical vulnerabilities found in modern APIs, including:

* **Broken Object Level Authorization:** Attackers exploit flaws to access data they shouldn't.
* **Broken Authentication:** Weak authentication allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users.
* **Excessive Data Exposure:** The API returns more data than the client needs, exposing sensitive information.
* **Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting:** The API is vulnerable to denial-of-service or brute-force attacks.
* **Injection Flaws:** Attackers send malicious data to be executed by the server.

## üí• Consequences of Inadequate Security

A failure to secure your APIs can result in:

* **Data Breaches:** Loss of customer data, intellectual property, and financial information.
* **Service Disruption:** Downtime that impacts your users and your business.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust, which can be difficult or impossible to regain.
* **Financial Loss:** Fines from regulatory bodies (like GDPR), cost of remediation, and loss of business.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Approach

This guide will provide you with the knowledge and tools to systematically address these risks through:

* **Comprehensive checklists** for each security area
