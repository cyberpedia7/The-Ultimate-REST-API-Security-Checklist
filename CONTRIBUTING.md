- Use bullet points for lists and checkboxes for actionable items
- Include code blocks with appropriate syntax highlighting
- Add links to relevant resources and references

### File Naming

- Use descriptive filenames with underscores
- Follow the existing numbering convention (00_, 01_, etc.)
- Use `.md` extension for all documentation files

## üîí Security Considerations

When contributing security-related content:

- **Verify accuracy** - Ensure all security recommendations are current and accurate
- **Cite sources** - Reference authoritative sources (OWASP, NIST, etc.)
- **Test recommendations** - Verify that suggested implementations work as described
- **Consider edge cases** - Address potential security implications of recommendations

## üìã Review Process

2. **Feedback** - You may receive suggestions for improvements
3. **Iteration** - Make requested changes and resubmit if needed
4. **Approval** - Once approved, your contribution will be merged

## üè∑Ô∏è Issue Labels

We use the following labels to categorize issues:

- `bug` - Something isn't working as expected
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `security` - Security-related issues or improvements
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed
